# Soldier-Strap-Final-Year-Project


The heart rate, temperature, and oxygen level in the blood will all be constantly tracked 
by a health monitoring system. Only that individual has access to this information. 
However, in my project, a health monitoring device would be used to track a soldier's 
health and communicate the information with nearby soldiers and the control room in 
the event of an emergency. These will lessen the soldier's risk and provide medical 
attention as quickly as possible.


Soldier identification tags prove to be one of the most under-studied and underresearched areas of study. The only distinguishing object in combat is a metal 
identification tag with the soldier's information on it. To locate and recognize those who 
have been killed, scan the entire war zone for dead bodies or identification tags. This 
task is not only time-consuming but also expensive, and it necessitates a large number 
of people to search the area. This device is often used to determine a soldierâ€™s position 
while he or she is in a lost state or situation.
